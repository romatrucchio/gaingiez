Impact Calculator - Killer Asteroids. 
Scientists from the University of Arizona have developed a handy calculator that you can use to determine your fate in the event of an asteroid impact. This tool takes into account not only the size of the asteroid and its composition, but what it slams into. It calculates the blast, depth. What would happen if a larger asteroid collided with Earth?  The Pacific Ocean. The impact peels the 10 km crust off the surface. The shockwave travels at hypersonic speeds. Debris is blasted across into low Earth orbit, and returns to destroy the surface of the Earth. Here you can play a physics based asteroid game, learn about how backyard astronomers are contributing to asteroid research, or hit any spot in the world with an asteroid using our Google Earth Impact simulation. Earth was born as a result of repeated asteroid collisions, the moon was created by a single giant impact event. Then, Earth's size attracted huge meteorites, which slammed into it, causing super-high-temperature rock vapour to cover the entire surface and evaporate all ocean water. Ben Winters, author of The Last Policeman (which I reviewed here), sent me a link to a website called Impact Earth! It was developed by Gareth Collins, HJ Melosh, and Robert Marcus at Purdue University. 
Tool for simulating the impact of an asteroid or comet with planets and moons in the Solar System. Famous Craters. Meteor Crater, USA. Projectile Diameter: 40 m Projectile Density: iron (8000 kg/m 3) Impact Velocity: 20 km/s Impact Angle: 45 degrees. Impact Earth allows you to create a virtual asteroid, pick its speed and see what would happens Ever wonder what would happen if an asteroid or a comet hit your hometown? Well, thanks to the Internet, there are ways to scratch that itch--digitally. Purdue University's ImpactEarth! lets you find out what could happen to our planet if it were struck by an asteroid (or a humpback whale ice sculpture).
